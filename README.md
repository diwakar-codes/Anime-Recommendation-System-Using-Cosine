# Anime-Recommendation-System-Using-Cosine
This project is a Content-Based Anime Recommendation System that suggests similar anime titles based on user input. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and cosine similarity to identify relationships between anime descriptions and recommend shows that share similar themes, genres, and narratives.
